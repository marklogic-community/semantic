*Note:* MarkLogic 7 introduces support for semantic queries, including support for 
all of the capabilities in SPARQL 1.0 and many of the capabilities in SPARQL 1.1. 
MarkLogic includes rich support for triples, and integrates querying triples with MarkLogic search in 
ways that allow you to not only create interesting semantic applications, but to integrate them with search in 
a rich way. For details, see the <a href="http://docs.marklogic.com/guide/semantics">Semantics Developer's Guide</a>.

If you are using MarkLogic 6 or earlier, you should stick with this toolkit.
