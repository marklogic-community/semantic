<title>Semantic Storage and Retrieval with MarkLogic Server</title>

<h1>Semantic Storage and Retrieval with MarkLogic Server</h1>

<p>
This project includes XQuery and Java code for storage and retrieval
of semantic content with MarkLogic Server.
The source code is available on the
<a href="http://github.com/marklogic/semantic">project page</a>.
</p>

<h2>Loading Semantic Data in MarkLogic Server</h2>
<p>
This project includes a plugin class, NQLoader,
which used <a href="http://sw.deri.org/2006/08/nxparser/">NXParser</a>
to extend <a href="http://github.com/marklogic/recordloader">RecordLoader</a>.
You will need a working installation of RecordLoader,
plus the NQLoader classes and related XQuery code.
You can download a jar file including the NQLoader class
<a href="semantic.jar">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p>
NQLoader expects input data as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Triples">N-Triples</a> or N-Quads.
If you have RDF-XML, you can use the
<a href="http://librdf.org/raptor/">Raptor</a> project's <code>rapper</code>
tool to convert to N-Triples.
</p>

<p>
RecordLoader can handle input from standard input, files, or zip archives.
It is often convenient to use zip archives, since they take very little
space on disk. With modern CPUs, RecordLoader can uncompress triples or quads
from the zip archives very quickly.
</p>

<h3>Configuring MarkLogic Server</h3>

<p>
The semantic queries supported in this project's XQuery code
require several range indexes.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Element range index on <code>s</code> as string,
  in the Unicode codepoint collation.</li>
<li>Element range index on <code>o</code> as string,
  in the Unicode codepoint collation.</li>
<li>Element range index on <code>p</code> as string,
  in the Unicode codepoint collation.</li>
<li>Element range index on <code>c</code> as string,
  in the Unicode codepoint collation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
As we will see below, querying semantic information in MarkLogic Server
does not usually rely on full-text queries. It is therefore possible
to save both disk space and memory by disabling all full-text indexes.
</p>

<p>
  The next section discusses ingestion via NQLoader,
  and will also touch on application server configuration.
</p>

<h3>Running NQLoader</h3>
<p>
Here is a sample configuration file for RecordLoader and NQLoader.
</p>

<pre>
CONFIGURATION_CLASSNAME=com.marklogic.semantic.Configuration
INPUT_PATTERN=^.+\\.nt$
THREADS=32
CONNECTION_STRING=http://admin:admin@host-1:8012/insert.xqy http://admin:admin@host-2:8012/insert.xqy
BATCH_SIZE=10
</pre>

<p>
The first property, <code>CONFIGURATION_CLASSNAME</code>, tells RecordLoader
to use the semantic plug-in for all configuration.
This also overrides the built-in Loader class
with the NQLoader from <code>semantic.jar</code>.
</p>

<p>
The next three properties are generic to any use of RecordLoader:
<code>INPUT_PATTERN</code> tells RecordLoader
to look for <code>*.nt</code> files or zip entries:
this is the standard extension for N-Triple and N-Quad files.
Next, <code>THREADS</code> tells RecordLoader to start a pool
of 32 worker threads. You may want more threads, or fewer,
depending on your server resources.
</p>

<p>
The next property, <code>CONNECTION_STRING</code>,
is also a generic part of RecordLoader,
and supports automatic load-balancing across multiple hosts.
However, NQLoader uses <code>CONNECTION_STRING</code> somewhat differently
than the built-in loaders do. Instead of being an XCC connection string,
this is an HTTP service to which NQLoader will <code>POST</code>
an XML representation of the input semantic triples or quads
(see <a href="#DOCUMENT_FORMAT">Document Format</a>, below).
The <code>insert.xqy</code> referred to by this connection string
must be available to the application server,
in this case the one running on port 8012 on host-1 and host-2.
This code is available from github:
<a href="http://github.com/marklogic/semantic/blob/master/src/xquery/insert.xqy">insert.xqy</a>.
</p>

<p>
Finally, NQLoader can buffer up an arbitrary number of triples or quads
to send to the <code>insert.xqy</code> module.
Since each triple or quad is small,
this buffering helps to improve ingestion performance.
The number of triples or quads in each buffer is governed by the
<code>BATCH_SIZE</code> property.
NQLoader also attempts to de-duplicate tuples on the fly,
using an LRU-like cache for recently-seen tuple data.
NQLoader also attempts to deterministically sent the same tuples
to the same <code>CONNECTION_STRING</code> URLs,
as long as the property remains constant.
</p>

<p>
Once we have assembled the necessary tools for RecordLoader and NQLoader,
and have configured MarkLogic Server with a database and an application server,
we can load content. Here is a sample Java command-line.
</p>

<pre>
java -cp recordloader.jar:semantic.jar:nxparser.jar:xpp3.jar \
  com.marklogic.ps.RecordLoader \
  nqloader.properties \
  *.zip
</pre>

<a id="DOCUMENT_FORMAT"/>
<h3>Document Format</h3>

<p>
NQLoader sends each triple or quad to MarkLogic Server
using a simplified XML representation.
</p>

<ul>
<li>The root element is <code>t</code></li>
<li>The subject element is <code>s</code></li>
<li>The object element is <code>o</code></li>
<li>The predicate element is <code>p</code></li>
<li>If present, the context element is <code>c</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
Here is a sample element, based on a triple from the
<a href="http://swat.cse.lehigh.edu/projects/lubm/">LeHigh University Benchmark</a>
(LUBM) corpus.
</p>

<pre>
&lt;t&gt;
  &lt;s&gt;http://www.Department17.University3.edu/UndergraduateStudent276&lt;/s&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;http://www.lehigh.edu/~zhp2/2004/0401/univ-bench.owl#emailAddress&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;o&gt;UndergraduateStudent276@Department17.University3.edu&lt;/o&gt;
&lt;/t&gt;
</pre>

<p>
By default, this document is inserted as properties of an empty
document.  This is also known as "naked properties".  You can use
xdmp:document-properties() to inspect them after loading.  The above
example would appear like this if you run xdmp:document-properties():
</p>

<pre>
&lt;prop:properties xmlns:prop="http://marklogic.com/xdmp/property"&gt;
  &lt;s&gt;http://www.Department17.University3.edu/UndergraduateStudent276&lt;/s&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;http://www.lehigh.edu/~zhp2/2004/0401/univ-bench.owl#emailAddress&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;o&gt;UndergraduateStudent276@Department17.University3.edu&lt;/o&gt;
  &lt;prop:last-modified&gt;2010-12-03T19:12:53-08:00&lt;/prop:last-modified&gt;
&lt;/prop:properties&gt;
</pre>

<p>
You can change this default placement back to inserting as documents
by modifying insert.xqy.  But this is not recommended because
inserting triples as naked properties saves a fragement.
</p>

<p>
You may also insert triples or quads manually,
using the <code>sem:tuple-insert()</code> function.
The library function will automatically generate the document URI
for each triple, and will generate XML similar to example above.
</p>

<h2>Querying Semantic Data in MarkLogic Server</h2>

<p>
Now that we have some semantic data in the server,
we can write simple queries that use XPath. For example:
</p>

<pre>
/t
  [s eq 'http://www.Department17.University3.edu/UndergraduateStudent276']
</pre>

<pre>
/t
  [s eq 'http://www.Department17.University3.edu/UndergraduateStudent276']
  [p eq 'http://www.lehigh.edu/~zhp2/2004/0401/univ-bench.owl#emailAddress']
  /o
</pre>

<p>
However, these XPath queries are not very interesting
from a semantic point of view. This is where the
<code><a href="http://github.com/marklogic/semantic/blob/master/src/xquery/semantic.xqy">semantic.xqy</a></code>
library becomes useful.
The next sections provide a brief overview of this library.
For more information about the join API,
see the <a href="function-reference.html">function reference</a>.
</p>

<h3>Transitive Closure - Friend of a Friend</h3>

<p>
One common task in semantic applications is to perform
transitive closure over an edge type. This is especially
useful for queries involving a "friend of a friend"
relationship. The <code>sem:transitive-closure()</code>
function can follow a relationship for a number of generations,
building a map that represents the matching network.
</p>

<pre>
xquery version "1.0-ml";

import module namespace sem="http://marklogic.com/semantic"
 at "semantic.xqy";

let $m := map:map()
let $seeds := xdmp:get-request-field('seed')
let $filters as xs:string* := xdmp:get-request-field('filter')
let $gen := 6
return sem:transitive-closure(
  $m, $seeds, $gen,
  'http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows',
  true(), $filters
)
</pre>

<p>
The semantic library also provides <code>sem:serialize()</code>
function, which can serialize the FOAF map to a flat text format.
</p>

<h3>Joins on Subject, Object, and Predicate</h3>

<p>
Let's look at a slightly more complex problem:
this is query 1 from the above-mentioned LUBM benchmark workload.
It returns all subjects that match a set of joins.
Each matching subject must be of type GraduateStudent
and must take a specific course.
</p>

<pre>
sem:subject-for-join(
  (sem:object-predicate-join(
    'http://www.Department0.University0.edu/GraduateCourse0',
    'http://www.lehigh.edu/~zhp2/2004/0401/univ-bench.owl#takesCourse'),
  sem:type-join(
    'http://www.lehigh.edu/~zhp2/2004/0401/univ-bench.owl#GraduateStudent')))
</pre>
